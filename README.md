# Be The Hero - Mobile

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide a way to help Non-Governmental Organisation find "Heroes" to help in their causes. This can be done by providing a [web](https://github.com/igorsouza-dev/bethehero-frontend) interface for the NGO to insert their needs and then a "Hero" can find these needs using a [mobile app](https://github.com/igorsouza-dev/bethehero-mobile) and get in touch with the organization.
You will need the backend of this project and you can find it [here](https://github.com/igorsouza-dev/bethehero-backend).
